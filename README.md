# concise-syntax

1. What does it do?
	- It toggles the visibility of unnecessary syntax.
2. Why and when to use it?
	- It is easier to read code when there is less syntax.
	- You may not use it when you are writing code.
3. How does it work?
	- It uses tokenColors rules along with a window script to synchronize the visibility of syntax.

## Development
- Launch the vscode `debugger` with `F5`. A warning will appear `The task "watch" cannot be tracked. Make sure to have a problem matcher defined`, click `Remember my choice for this task` and `Debug Anyway`.
	- Why does this happen? The build script `vite.config.custom.ts` needs to build the extension and the window side. That script doesn't have a problem matcher defined in `.vscode/tasks.json` so vscode doesn't know how to track it. The warning is harmless and can be ignored.

## Known Issues

- `Your Code installation appears to be corrupt. Please reinstall.`
	- The extension spawns a window script and vscode doesn't like that. That script syncs the window state with the extension.

- This extension is a workaround for a feature that is not yet available in VSCode.
	- Which is the ability to toggle tokenColors and or apply partial theme rules.
It is highly over engineered for what it does: toggle css styles on and off.
That being said, it is a proof of concept about how to communicate between the extension and the window.

		Glims of hope	- The following shows how simple it could be to toggle tokenColors.
